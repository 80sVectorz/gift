# GIFT
Generalized interactive fiction tool

GIFT is a toolkit/library that tries to offer a generalized foundation for creating text-based interactive experiences. It's a pet project of mine and will probably never be in a finished state.
I don't recommend actually using it. I just put up the code for anyone who may be inspired by it.

# Inspiration
I have always been fascinated by text-based games. The genre was a product of limited technology and the business oriented nature of computers. With only text at people's disposal, they had to make due with what they had.
Even though, text-based games faded into obscurity when graphical games reached the masses. I still think they can offer greater flexibility over modern graphical games.
The absence of complex graphics lets you sketch complex scenes for a fraction of the cost. With words, you can tell and describe so much. Still, the flexibility of these games is largely limited by the need for every interaction to be accounted for.
With this project my aim is to build a system that allows for easy expansion by creating a generalized interconnected system for objects, actions and interactions.

# Brainstorming document
It's best to look at the brainstorming document to understand this project. I try to write out my thought process about systems and potential ways to solve problems in that file.

# Extra monologue
I see one more limit with text-based games compared to graphical games, which is the lack of accurate spatial awareness. The benefit of seeing your surrounds is that it offers spatial gameplay. I personally think this could be solved in a way similar to how Dwarf Fortress does it.
The ascii graphics version of DF is another big inspiration for me, it's a good mix between the great content flexibily of text and the in depth spatial awareness of modern games.
